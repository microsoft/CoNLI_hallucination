The dismissal of Paul Downton as England's managing director may be the big talking point in English cricket but focus has already shifted to the start of the county championship season. However, you don't have to go to far before talk returns to the England team again as Kevin Pietersen cut a range of emotions as he posed for the Surrey team photo before the start of the new campaign. Pietersen looked in deep thought as he sat right at the end of the team photo, but was otherwise in a jovial mood as a potentially sensational return to the England set-up took a step closer.

Downton's sacking on Wednesday has paved the way for the 34-year-old to return to the international set-up having been controversially axed by the former managing director in 2014. It was during the last Ashes tour for England in Australia last year when Pietersen last featured at international level, in a disastrous trip which saw his side suffer a whitewash series defeat. With England hoping to regain the urn this summer on home soil, Pietersen has rejoined Surrey in an attempt to force his way back into the Test set-up.
