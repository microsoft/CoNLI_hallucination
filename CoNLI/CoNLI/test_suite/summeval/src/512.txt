Esteban Cambiasso has won all the major European competitions a player can during his illustrious career but revealed that keeping Leicester City in the Premier League would be up there with the best. The Foxes are currently seven points adrift at the bottom of the table, with only eight games remaining, knowing that time is running out to save themselves. Cambiasso refuses to give up and admits that keeping Leicester up will feel like winning a trophy. Esteban Cambiasso says that helping keep Leicester in the Premier League will feel like winning a trophy 'For me, it's like another cup,' he told BBC East Midlands Today. 'When you start another season you have an objective, and this is the objective for us. 'For me, winning a cup or winning the league with another team is the same now as having the possibility to save Leicester in the Premier League.' The Argentinian midfielder poses with the trophy after his team won the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup Cambiasso had an illustrious career at Inter Milan, winning an impressive 15 trophies during his stint River Plate (2001-2002) Argentine Primera Division Real Madrid (2002-2004) La Liga Super Cup Supercopa de Espana Inter Milan (2004-2014) Champions League Serie A (5) Coppa Italia (4) Supercoppa (4) FIFA Club World Cup Having not won a game since January, Nigel Pearson's men face West Ham United on Saturday and Cambiasso is still convinced they can avoid the drop. 'I understood when I signed for Leicester it's not an easy job to stay in the Premier League,' he said. 'It's a difficult situation but I think we have our chances to win matches. There's a quarter of the Premier League left to finish. 'I think some people think for Leicester all is finished. But I'm sure, because I watch my team-mates every day, we can save Leicester and stay in the Premier League.' The former Inter Milan star signed for the Foxes in the summer, leaving Italy after ten years and embarking on a new challenge in England. After agreeing to a one-year-deal, Cambiasso has quickly established himself as a key player but it remains to be seen if he'll still be in the East Midlands at the start of next season. The former Real Madrid man was also successful during his short spell in Spain for Real Madrid Cambiasso played during Real's 'Galatico' era, with Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and David Beckham 'Leicester always wanted me,' he added. 'After these nine months or eight months, I'm very happy because my family is OK, and I'm good. 'I want a few more points, but all the rest is perfect.' Cambiasso is happy in the East Midlands and could stay beyond his current one-year-deal
