Manchester City are keen to sign Anderlecht teenager Evangelos Patoulidis. The 14-year-old playmaker is regarded as one of the best talents to emerge from Anderlecht's youth set-up and has also attracted attention from Arsenal and Barcelona. The Belgian starlet rejected a move to Barcelona's La Masia academy when he was 12 as his family wanted him to continue his studies. He has continued to impress and City have held discussions with Anderlecht chairman Roger Vanden Stock in the hope of agreeing a compensation package.
