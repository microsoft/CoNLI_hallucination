Sir Bradley Wiggins will bid for cycling's hour record on June 7 at London's Olympic Velodrome. The four-time Olympic champion and 2012 Tour de France winner, who is 35 on April 28, will attempt to add to his accomplishments by riding the furthest distance in 60 minutes at the Lee Valley VeloPark. 'The Hour Record is a holy grail for cyclists,' Wiggins said. Four-time Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins will bid to break cycling's hour record in June Wiggins finished his Team Sky career in the Paris-Roubaix 253.5km one-day race on Sunday Australian rider Rohan Dennis poses after breaking the world hour record on February 8 in Grenchen 'It's been fought over tooth and nail by some of the greatest names in our sport for over a hundred years and it's time for me to have a crack at it. 'I like the idea of challenging myself and want to motivate people to do the same - so why not get your bike out of the shed and see how far you can go in an hour?' Wiggins, whose track pedigree includes three Olympic gold medals, is expected to set a mark which will last for some time. Wiggins will hope for a capacity 6,000 crowd to spur on his attempt, with tickets going on sale from April 19, while the event will be broadcast live on Sky Sports. In June, Wiggins will hope to race in front of a sell-out crowd at London's Olympic Velodrome Wiggins (left) alongside his Team Sky colleague Luke Rowe after the pair raced the Paris-Roubaix Wiggins will look to beat the record of Dennis (pictured), who managed to cycle 52.491km in an hour The Briton finished his Team Sky career at Paris-Roubaix last Sunday and will ride in next month's inaugural Tour de Yorkshire for his eponymous team before preparing for the Hour as part of his return to the track. The world time-trial champion is targeting a British record eighth Olympic medal - he has four gold, one silver and two bronze - at the 2016 Rio Olympics in the four-man, four-kilometre team pursuit. The current Hour record is 52.491km, set by Australian Rohan Dennis in February after the UCI, cycling's world governing body, reformed regulations, reigniting interest in the event. German Jens Voigt was the first to make an attempt last September, recording 51.115km, a mark which stood for six weeks before Austria's Matthias Brandle rode 51.852km, while Jack Bobridge was the first to fall short in his attempt. Dennis' mark will come under threat from Briton Alex Dowsett, who will make his attempt on May 2 in Manchester having had to postpone it previously after suffering a broken collarbone. Tickets to watch Sir Bradley Wiggins attempt to break the UCI Hour Record at the Lee Valley VeloPark on June 7 will go on sale to the general public through Sky Tickets from Friday, April 19 (10am) price £49, £39 and £29, on line sale only through the Sky Tickets website.
