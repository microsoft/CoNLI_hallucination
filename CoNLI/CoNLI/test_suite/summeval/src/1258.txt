Carlos Tevez has been told to terminate his contract with Juventus to complete a return to his former club Boca Juniors in Argentina. The former Manchester City striker's deal with the Serie A champions does not expire until the end of next season but he has reportedly told the club he wishes to leave this summer. Boca have confirmed they are close to completing a deal for the 31-year-old, but club president Daniel Angelici has stressed that Tevez must terminate his contract with the Italians first. Carlos Tevez has shocked Juventus by suggesting he wants to leave the club this summer Tevez is on course to win a second Serie A title with the Old Lady and still has a shot at European glory 'We must be careful', Angelici told TYC Sports. 'We know that he wants to return to Argentina with Boca Juniors but he must first terminate his contract with Juventus, which runs until 2016. 'We are close to sealing his return and it will be done shortly.' The Argentina international joined Boca's youth academy in 1996 and went on to score 26 league goals in 76 appearances for the club before joining Corinthians in 2005. Although Juventus are reluctant to lose the league's top scorer - Tevez has netted 17 times this season - they have accepted the player wants to leave and have already started identifying potential replacements. Italian paper Tuttosport claims the 31-year-old has already decided to leave the club this summer Tevez has always said he intends to finish his career back at his first club Boca Juniors in Argentina Carlos Tevez                             17 Mauro Icardi                              16 Jeremy Menez                          16 Tevez's international manager Tata Martino claims any potential move would have no bearing on the player's Argentina future. 'The most important thing for me is that Tevez continues to play as well as he is at the moment,' Martino told Italian paper Tuttosport. 'It doesn't matter whether that's at Juventus or Boca. Only he'll know what's best for his future. 'I will say this, though: Juventus are a great team, but so are Boca Juniors. It wouldn't be a step down.'
