One Missouri mom is making the best out of a less than ideal situation. Becky Schoenig of St. Louis, Missouri was shocked when she realized her brand new 2015 Ford Fusion had been stolen from her driveway on Monday night, just a little over a month after she took the car home. Then, on April 1, Schoenig was shocked to learn that police had found her car after receiving a tip from a man who recognized the vehicle as Schoenig's and would be returning it to her - but with a few minor changes.

This b***h is pimpin now!!!' As the car pulled up, Schoenig noticed that the rims had been spray painted red, there was red detailing on the sides of the car, and her steering wheel now had some orange accents. Rather than get upset however, she simply took to Facebook and posted a photo of her and her new ride, writing; 'I want to thank the car thieves for pimping out my vehicle for me.... This b***h is pimpin now!!!' She also attached a photo of the car which, given the date, many thought was a joke. It was not all 'lollipops and rainbows' though Schoenig told KSDK, and she is now getting the vehicle professionally cleaned to deal with the strong smell of cigarettes and marijuana. She is also creating a smoothie at the restaurant she owns, The Hot Pot, to honor Mick Sexton, the man who located her car and notified police. The Sexton on Wheels will feature banana, pineapple, peach and coconut cream. 'She's a very special person,' said Marlene Trice, a friend of Schoenig. 'She is vibrant and happy and really loves making people laugh.'
