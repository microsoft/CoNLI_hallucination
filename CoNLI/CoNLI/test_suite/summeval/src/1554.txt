Souness said, 'It's a decent forearm smash. I mean he does stick his elbow in the back of Falcao's head and that's a foul.' He added, 'If that elbow's not there he's not going down like that.' Former Arsenal captain Henry, meanwhile, felt sympathy for Falcao as a fellow striker. Asked if he would have wanted a foul in that position as a player, the Frenchman responded, 'Yes, all day long.'
