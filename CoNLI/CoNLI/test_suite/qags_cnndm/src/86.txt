Children are known to copy the actions of their parents. And one adorable little girl has mastered a brilliant impression of her pregnant mother. Captured in a 15 - second clip, the youngster emulates the way her pregnant mother walks - and the result is hilarious. The 15 - month - old girl arches her back and pushes out her belly while strutting around the room. The youngster pulls a cheeky face while her father also mimics the mum's pregnant walk in the background. The clip begins with mum, american teri o' neil, 30, asking 15 - month - old olivia : `how does mama walk?' While filming at her home. Suddenly the youngster appears from the side of the shot and with her back bent and tummy pushed forward she struts past. She pulls a cheeky face as she continues around the room - - in the background her father can be seen emulating the walk with her. The video concludes with olivia briefly interacting with the dog, who jumps out of the way, and walking towards the camera with a beaming smile. According to teri, she recorded the video when she was six months pregnant with her son liam. The mother of two writes about her children on her blog and has documented everything from their birth stories to the everyday things they get up to. She also uploads numerous videos to her youtube channel, which shows the youngsters taking their first steps and of course, imitating her.
